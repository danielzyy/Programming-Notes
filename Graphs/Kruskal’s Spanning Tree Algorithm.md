# Kruskalâ€™s Spanning Tree Algorithm
Kruskal's algorithm is a minimum-spanning-tree algorithm which finds an edge of the least possible weight that connects any two nodes. A spanning tree is a graph that does not have loops, and reaches all nodes. It has N-1 edges. A root is the first edge that you add, the common edge to other nodes. If the next node has a different parent than the current node, connect them with an edge. If the next node has the same root as the current node, do not add the edge into the tree because it will form a loop. A set is collection of nodes that are connected.\
Steps for using Kruskal's algorithm to find the Minumum Spanning Tree(MST):
1. Sort all the edges from smallest ot largest based on their weight.
2. Pick the edge with the smallest value. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far, if it does not, add it to the MST.
3. Repeat step #2 until there are (V-1) edges in the MST.
## Implementation
Edge objects are used to store the beginning vertex(bv), end vertex(ev) and cost of the edge.\
The class must implement Comparable<Edge>, so that the .compareTo method can be used to sort the edges based on weight.\
A method is created to find the parent of a node, if they do not share a parent then that edge will not form a cycle, so another method will join the parents after that edge has been added to the MST.
